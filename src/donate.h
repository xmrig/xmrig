/*
 * Dev donation.
 *
 * Percentage of your hashing power that you want to donate to the developer can be 0% but supports XMRig Development.
 *
 * Example of how it works for the setting of 1%:
 * Your miner will mine into your usual pool for a random time (in a range from 49.5 to 148.5 minutes),
 * then switch to the developer's pool for 1 minute, then switch again to your pool for 99 minutes
 * and then switch again to developer's pool for 1 minute; these rounds will continue until the miner stops.
 *
 * Randomised only on the first round to prevent waves on the donation pool.
 *
 * Switching is instant and only happens after a successful connection, so you never lose any hashes.
 *
 * If you plan on changing donations to 0%, please consider making a one-off donation to my wallet:
