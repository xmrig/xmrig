# This is the VERSION file for hwloc, describing the precise version
# of hwloc in this distribution.  The various components of the version
# number below are combined to form a single version number string.

# major, minor, and release are generally combined in the form
# <major>.<minor>.<release>.  If release is zero, then it is omitted.

# Please update HWLOC_VERSION* in contrib/windows/hwloc_config.h too.

major=2
minor=11
release=2

# greek is used for alpha or beta release tags.  If it is non-empty,
# it will be appended to the version number.  It does not have to be
# numeric.  Common examples include a1 (alpha release 1), b1 (beta
# release 1), sc2005 (Super Computing 2005 release).  The only
# requirement is that it must be entirely printable ASCII characters
# and have no white space.

# The date when this release was created

date="Sep 26, 2024"

# If snapshot=1, then use the value from snapshot_version as the
# entire hwloc version (i.e., ignore major, minor, release, and
# greek).  This is only set to 1 when making snapshot tarballs.

# is maintained in accordance with the "Library Interface Versions"
# chapter from the GNU Libtool documentation.  Notes:

# 1. Since version numbers are associated with *releases*, the version
# number maintained on the hwloc git master (and developer branches)
# is always 0:0:0.

# 2. Version numbers are described in the Libtool current:revision:age
# format.
