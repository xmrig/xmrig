This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of hwloc since version
0.9.


Version 2.10.0
--------------
* Heterogeneous Memory core improvements
  + Better heuristics to identify the subtype of memory such as HBM,
    DRAM, NVM, CXL-DRAM, etc.
  + Build memory tiers, i.e. sets of NUMA nodes with the same subtype
    and similar performance.
    - NUMA node tier ranks are exposed in the new MemoryTier info
      attribute (starts from 0 for highest bandwidth tier)..
  + See the new Heterogeneous Memory section in the documentation.
* API
  + Add hwloc_topology_free_group_object() to discard a Group created
    by hwloc_topology_alloc_group_object().
* Linux backend
  + Fix cpukinds on NVIDIA Grace to report identical cores even if they
    actually have very small frequency differences.
    Thanks to John C. Linford for the report.
  + Add CXLDevice attributes to CXL DAX objects and NUMA nodes to show
    which PCI device implements which window.
  + Ignore buggy memory-side caches and memory attributes when fake NUMA
    emulation is enabled on the Linux kernel command-line.
  + Add more info attributes in MemoryModule Misc objects,
    thanks to Zubiao Xiong for the patch.
  + Get CPUModel and CPUFamily info attributes on LoongArch platforms.
* x86 backend
  + Add support for new AMD CPUID leaf 0x80000026 for better detection
    of Core Complex and Die on Zen4 processors.
  + Improve Zhaoxin CPU topology detection.
* Tools
  + Input locations and many command-line options (e.g. hwloc-calc -I -N -H,
    lstopo --only) now accept filters such as "NUMA[HBM]" so that only
    objects are that type and subtype are considered.
    - NUMA[tier=1] is also accepted for selecting NUMA nodes depending
      on their MemoryTier info attribute.
  + Add --object-output to hwloc-calc to report the type as a prefix to
    object indexes, e.g. Core:2 instead of 2 in the output of -I.
  + hwloc-info --ancestor and --descendants now accepts kinds of objects
    instead of single types.
    - The new --first option only shows the first matching object.
  + Add --children-of-pid to hwloc-ps to show a hierarchy of processes.
    Thanks to Antoine Morvan for the suggestion.
  + Add --misc-from to lstopo to add Misc objects described in a file.
    - To be combined with the new hwloc-ps --lstopo-misc for a customizable
      lstopo --top replacement.
* Misc
  + lstopo may now configure the layout of memory object placed above,
    for instance with --children-order memory:above:vert.
  + Fix XML import from memory or stdin when using libxml2 2.12.

* Fix hwloc_get_next_child() when there are some memory-side caches.
* Don't crash if the topology is empty because Linux cgroups are wrong.
* Improve some hwloc-bind warnings in case of command-line parsing errors.
* Many documentation improvements all over the place, including:
  + hwloc_topology_restrict() and hwloc_topology_insert_group() may reorder
    children, causing the logical indexes of objects to change.


Version 2.9.2
-------------
* Don't forget L3i when defining filters for multiple levels of caches
  with hwloc_topology_set_cache/icache_types_filter().
* Fix object total_memory after hwloc_topology_insert_group_object().

  are removed because of HWLOC_RESTRICT_FLAG_REMOVE_CPULESS but no PUs are.
  Thanks to Mark Grondona for reporting the issue.
* Mark HPE Cray Slingshot NICs with subtype "Slingshot".


Version 2.9.0
-------------

* Tools
  + lstopo now switches to console mode when its output is redirected.
    Graphical window mode may be forced back with --of window.
  + hwloc-calc now accepts "numa" in -H, and I/O subtypes such as "gpu"
    in -I and -N.


Version 2.8.0
-------------
* API
  + Add HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_NO_DISTANCES, _NO_MEMATTRS and _NO_CPUKINDS
    to reduce the overhead when unneeded.
  + Add separate Read/Write Bandwidth/Latency memory attributes and
    implement them on Linux.
* Backends
  + NUMA nodes may now have a subtype such as DRAM, HBM, SPM, or NVM
    on heterogeneous memory platforms on Linux.
    - Add DAXType and DAXParent attributes on Linux to tell where a
      DAX device or its corresponding NUMA node come from (SPM for
      Specific-Purpose or NVM for Non-Volatile Memory).
  + Detect heterogeneous caches in hybrid CPUs on MacOS X,
    thanks to Paul Bone for the help.
  + Max frequencies are not ignored in Linux cpukinds anymore (they were
    ignored in hwloc 2.7.0), but they may be slightly adjusted to avoid
    reporting hybrid CPUs because Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0.
    - See the documentation of environment variable HWLOC_CPUKINDS_MAXFREQ.
  + Hardwire the PCI locality of HPE Cray EX235a nodes.
* Tools
  + lstopo and other tools may now load Linux and x86 cpuid topology files
    from a tarball.
  + lstopo may now replace the P# and L# index prefixes with custom strings
    thanks to --os-index-prefix and --logical-index-prefix options.
* Misc
  + Add --disable-readme to avoid regenerating the top-level hwloc README
    file from the documentation.

Version 2.7.0
-------------
* Backends
  + Add support for NUMA nodes and caches with more than 64 PUs across
    multiple processor groups on Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022.
  + Group objects are not created for Windows processor groups anymore,
    except if HWLOC_WINDOWS_PROCESSOR_GROUP_OBJS=1 in the environment.
  + Expose "Cluster" group objects on Linux kernel 5.16+ for CPUs
    that share some internal cache or bus. This can be equivalent
    to the L2 Cache level on some platforms (e.g. x86) or a specific
    level between L2 and L3 on others (e.g. ARM Kungpeng 920).
    Thanks to Jonathan Cameron for the help.
    - HWLOC_DONT_MERGE_CLUSTER_GROUPS=1 may be set in the environment
      to prevent these groups from being merged with identical caches, etc.
  + Improve the oneAPI LevelZero backend:
    - Expose subdevices such as "ze0.1" inside root OS devices ("ze0")
      when the hardware contains multiple subdevices.
    - Add many new attributes to describe device type, and the
      numbers of slices, subslices, execution units and threads.
    - Expose the memory information as LevelZeroHBM/DDR/MemorySize infos.
  + Ignore the max frequencies of cores in Linux cpukinds when the
    base frequencies are available (to avoid exposing hybrid CPUs
    when Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 gives slightly different max
    frequencies to CPU cores).
    - May be reverted by setting HWLOC_CPUKINDS_MAXFREQ=1 in the environment.
* Tools
  + Add --grey and --palette options to switch lstopo to greyscale or
    white-background-only graphics, or to tune individual colors.
* Build
  + Windows CMake builds now support non-MSVC compilers, detect several
    features at build time, can build/run tests, etc.
    Thanks to Michael Hirsch and Alexander Neumann .


Version 2.6.0
-------------
* Backends
  + Expose two cpukinds for energy-efficient cores (icestorm) and
    high-performance cores (firestorm) on Apple M1 on Mac OS X.

    on Linux when available (mostly on recent ARM platforms for now).
  + Improve HWLOC_MEMBIND_BIND (without the STRICT flag) on Linux kernel
    >= 5.15: If more than one node is given, the kernel may now use all
    of them instead of only the first one before falling back to others.
  + Expose cache os_index when available on Linux, it may be needed
    when using resctrl to configure cache partitioning, memory bandwidth
    monitoring, etc.
  + Add a "XGMIHops" distances matrix in the RSMI backend for AMD GPU
    interconnected through XGMI links.
  + Expose AMD GPU memory information (VRAM and GTT) in the RSMI backend.
  + Add OS devices such as "bxi0" for Atos/Bull BXI HCAs on Linux.

    - Use a custom installation path if specified with --with-rocm=<dir>.
    - Use /opt/rocm-<version> if specified with --with-rocm-version=<version>
      or the ROCM_VERSION environment variable.
    - Try /opt/rocm if it exists.
    - See "How do I enable ROCm SMI and select which version to use?"
      in the FAQ for details.
  + Add a CMakeLists for Windows under contrib/windows-cmake/ .

    - hwloc-annotate and lstopo have new distances-transform options.
  + hwloc_distances_add() is replaced with _add_create() followed by
    _add_values() and _add_commit(). See hwloc/distances.h for details.
  + Add topology flags to mitigate binding modifications during
    hwloc discovery, especially on Windows:
    - HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_RESTRICT_TO_CPUBINDING and _MEMBINDING
      restrict discovery to PUs and NUMA nodes inside the binding.
    - HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_DONT_CHANGE_BINDING prevents from ever
      changing the binding during discovery.
* Backends
  + Add a levelzero backend for oneAPI L0 devices, exposed as OS devices
    of subtype "LevelZero" and name such as "ze0".
    - Add hwloc/levelzero.h for interoperability between converting
      between L0 API devices and hwloc cpusets or OS devices.
  + Expose NEC Vector Engine cards on Linux as OS devices of subtype
    "VectorEngine" and name "ve0", etc.
    Thanks to Anara Kozhokanova, Tim Cramer and Erich Focht for the help.
  + Add a NVLinkBandwidth distances structure between NVIDIA GPUs
    (and POWER processor or NVSwitches) in the NVML backend,
    and a XGMIBandwidth distances structure between AMD GPUs
    in the RSMI backends.
    - See "Topology Attributes: Distances, Memory Attributes and CPU Kinds"
      in the documentation for details about these new distances.
  + Add support for NUMA node 0 being offline in Linux, thanks to Jirka Hladky.
* Build
  + Add --with-cuda-version=<version> or look at the CUDA_VERSION
    environment variable to find the appropriate CUDA pkg-config files.
    Thanks to Stephen Herbein for the suggestion.
    - Also add --with-cuda=<dir> to specify the CUDA installation path
      manually (and its NVML and OpenCL components).
      Thanks to Andrea Bocci for the suggestion.

    typically on heterogeneous platforms.
    - When available, bandwidths and latencies are read from the ACPI HMAT
      table exposed by Linux kernel 5.2+.
    - Attributes may also be customized to expose user-defined performance
      information.
  + Add hwloc_get_local_numanode_objs() for listing NUMA nodes that are

  + The new topology flag HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IMPORT_SUPPORT causes
    support arrays to be loaded from XML exported with hwloc 2.3+.
    - hwloc_topology_get_support() now returns an additional "misc"
      array with feature "imported_support" set when support was imported.

    blacklisted.
    - The linuxio component has been merged back into the linux component.
* Tools
  + lstopo
    - lstopo factorizes objects by default in the graphical output when
      there are more than 4 identical children.
      . New options --no-factorize and --factorize may be used to configure this.

      shortcuts to dynamically customize the attributes, legend, etc.
    - Add --linespacing and change default margins and linespacing.
    - Add --allow for changing allowed sets.
    - Add a native SVG backend. Its graphical output may be slightly less

-------------
* Add support for Linux 5.3 new sysfs cpu topology files with Die information.
* Add support for Intel v2 Extended Topology Enumeration in the x86 backend.
* Tiles, Modules and Dies are exposed as Groups for now.
  + HWLOC_DONT_MERGE_DIE_GROUPS=1 may be set in the environment to prevent
    Die groups from being automatically merged with identical parent or children.
* Ignore NUMA node information from AMD topoext in the x86 backend,
  unless HWLOC_X86_TOPOEXT_NUMANODES=1 is set in the environment.
* Group objects have a new "dont_merge" attribute to prevent them from

  thanks to Gilles Gouaillardet for the suggestion.


Version 2.0.1 (also included in 1.11.10 when relevant)
-------------
* Bump the library soname to 15:0:0 to avoid conflicts with hwloc 1.11.x
  releases. The hwloc 2.0.0 soname was buggy (12:0:0), applications will
  have to be recompiled.
* Serialize pciaccess discovery to fix concurrent topology loads in
  multiple threads.
* Fix hwloc-dump-hwdata to only process SMBIOS information that correspond
  to the KNL and KNM configuration.
* Add a heuristic for guessing KNL/KNM memory and cluster modes when
  hwloc-dump-hwdata could not run as root earlier.
* Add --no-text lstopo option to remove text from some boxes in the
  graphical output. Mostly useful for removing Group labels.
* Some minor fixes to memory binding.


Version 2.0.0
-------------
*** The ABI of the library has changed. ***
  For instance some hwloc_obj fields were reordered, added or removed, see below.
  + HWLOC_API_VERSION and hwloc_get_api_version() now give 0x00020000.
  + See "How do I handle ABI breaks and API upgrades ?" in the FAQ
    and "Upgrading to hwloc 2.0 API" in the documentation.
* Major API changes
  + Memory, I/O and Misc objects are now stored in dedicated children lists,
    not in the usual children list that is now only used for CPU-side objects.
    - hwloc_get_next_child() may still be used to iterate over these 4 lists
      of children at once.
    - hwloc_obj_type_is_normal(), _memory() and _io() may be used to check
      the kind of a given object type.
  + Topologies always have at least one NUMA object. On non-NUMA machines,
    a single NUMA object is added to describe the entire machine memory.
    The NUMA level cannot be ignored anymore.
  + The NUMA level is special since NUMA nodes are not in the main hierarchy
    of objects anymore. Its depth is a fake negative depth that should not be
    compared with normal levels.
    - If all memory objects are attached to parents at the same depth,
      it may be retrieved with hwloc_get_memory_parents_depth().
  + The HWLOC_OBJ_CACHE type is replaced with 8 types HWLOC_OBJ_L[1-5]CACHE
    and HWLOC_OBJ_L[1-3]ICACHE that remove the need to disambiguate levels
    when looking for caches with _by_type() functions.
    - New hwloc_obj_type_is_{,d,i}cache() functions may be used to check whether
      a given type is a cache.
  + Reworked ignoring/filtering API
    - Replace hwloc_topology_ignore*() functions with hwloc_topology_set_type_filter()
      and hwloc_topology_set_all_types_filter().
      . Contrary to hwloc_topology_ignore_{type,all}_keep_structure() which
        removed individual objects, HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_STRUCTURE only removes
        entire levels (so that topology do not become too asymmetric).
    - Remove HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_ICACHES in favor of hwloc_topology_set_icache_types_filter()
      with HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_ALL.
    - Remove HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IO_DEVICES, _IO_BRIDGES and _WHOLE_IO in favor of
      hwloc_topology_set_io_types_filter() with HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_ALL or
      HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_IMPORTANT.
  + The distance API has been completely reworked. It is now described
    in hwloc/distances.h.
  + Return values
    - Most functions in hwloc/bitmap.h now return an int that may be negative
      in case of failure to realloc/extend the internal storage of a bitmap.
    - hwloc_obj_add_info() also returns an int in case allocations fail.
* Minor API changes
  + Object attributes
    - obj->memory is removed.
      . local_memory and page_types attributes are now in obj->attr->numanode
      . total_memory moves obj->total_memory.
    - Objects do not have allowed_cpuset and allowed_nodeset anymore.
      They are only available for the entire topology using
      hwloc_topology_get_allowed_cpuset() and hwloc_topology_get_allowed_nodeset().
    - Objects now have a "subtype" field that supersedes former "Type" and
      "CoProcType" info attributes.
  + Object and level depths are now signed ints.
  + Object string printing and parsing
    - hwloc_type_sscanf() deprecates the old hwloc_obj_type_sscanf().
    - hwloc_type_sscanf_as_depth() is added to convert a type name into
      a level depth.
    - hwloc_obj_cpuset_snprintf() is deprecated in favor of hwloc_bitmap_snprintf().
  + Misc objects
    - Replace hwloc_topology_insert_misc_object_by_cpuset() with
      hwloc_topology_insert_group_object() to precisely specify the location
      of an additional hierarchy level in the topology.
    - Misc objects have their own level and depth to iterate over all of them.
    - Misc objects may now only be inserted as a leaf object with
      hwloc_topology_insert_misc_object() which deprecates
      hwloc_topology_insert_misc_object_by_parent().
  + hwloc_topology_restrict() doesn't remove objects that contain memory
    by default anymore.
    - The list of existing restrict flags was modified.
  + The discovery support array now contains some NUMA specific bits.
  + XML export functions take an additional flags argument,
    for instance for exporting XMLs that are compatible with hwloc 1.x.
  + Functions diff_load_xml*(), diff_export_xml*() and diff_destroy() in
    hwloc/diff.h do not need a topology as first parameter anymore.
  + hwloc_parse_cpumap_file () superseded by hwloc_linux_read_path_as_cpumask()
    in hwloc/linux.h.
  + HWLOC_MEMBIND_DEFAULT and HWLOC_MEMBIND_FIRSTTOUCH were clarified.
* New APIs and Features
  + Add hwloc/shmem.h for sharing topologies between processes running on
    the same machine (for reducing the memory footprint).
  + Add the experimental netloc subproject. It is disabled by default
    and can be enabled with --enable-netloc.
    It currently brings command-line tools to gather and visualize the
    topology of InfiniBand fabrics, and an API to convert such topologies
    into Scotch architectures for process mapping.
    See the documentation for details.
* Removed APIs and features
  + Remove the online_cpuset from struct hwloc_obj. Offline PUs get unknown
    topologies on Linux nowadays, and wrong topology on Solaris. Other OS
    do not support them. And one cannot do much about them anyway. Just keep
    them in complete_cpuset.
  + Remove the now-unused "System" object type HWLOC_OBJ_SYSTEM,
    defined to MACHINE for backward compatibility.
  + The almost-unused "os_level" attribute has been removed from the
    hwloc_obj structure.
  + Remove the custom interface for assembling the topologies of different
    nodes as well as the hwloc-assembler tools.
  + hwloc_topology_set_fsroot() is removed, the environment variable
    HWLOC_FSROOT may be used for the same remote testing/debugging purpose.
  + Remove the deprecated hwloc_obj_snprintf(), hwloc_obj_type_of_string(),
    hwloc_distribute[v]().
  * Remove Myrinet Express interoperability (hwloc/myriexpress.h).
  + Remove Kerrighed support from the Linux backend.
  + Remove Tru64 (OSF/1) support.
    - Remove HWLOC_MEMBIND_REPLICATE which wasn't available anywhere else.
* Backend improvements
  + Linux
    - OS devices do not have to be attached through PCI anymore,
      for instance enabling the discovery of NVDIMM block devices.
    - Remove the dependency on libnuma.
    - Add a SectorSize attribute to block OS devices.
  + Mac OS X
    - Fix detection of cores and hyperthreads.
    - Add CPUVendor, Model, ... attributes.
  + Windows
    - Add get_area_memlocation().
* Tools
  + lstopo and hwloc-info have a new --filter option matching the new filtering API.
  + lstopo can be given --children-order=plain to force a basic displaying
    of memory and normal children together below their parent.
  + hwloc-distances was removed and replaced with lstopo --distances.
* Misc
  + Exports
    - Exporting to synthetic now ignores I/O and Misc objects.
  + PCI discovery
    - Separate OS device discovery from PCI discovery. Only the latter is disabled
      with --disable-pci at configure time. Both may be disabled with --disable-io.
    - The `linuxpci' component is now renamed into `linuxio'.
    - The old `libpci' component name from hwloc 1.6 is not supported anymore,
      only the `pci' name from hwloc 1.7 is now recognized.
    - The HWLOC_PCI_<domain>_<bus>_LOCALCPUS environment variables are superseded
      with a single HWLOC_PCI_LOCALITY where bus ranges may be specified.
    - Do not set PCI devices and bridges name automatically. Vendor and device
      names are already in info attributes.
  + Components and discovery
    - Add HWLOC_SYNTHETIC environment variable to enforce a synthetic topology
      as if hwloc_topology_set_synthetic() had been called.
    - HWLOC_COMPONENTS doesn't support xml or synthetic component attributes
      anymore, they should be passed in HWLOC_XMLFILE or HWLOC_SYNTHETIC instead.
    - HWLOC_COMPONENTS takes precedence over other environment variables
      for selecting components.
  + hwloc now requires a C99 compliant compiler.

    easy to find.
    - See "How do I find the local MCDRAM NUMA node on Intel Knights
      Landing Xeon Phi?" in the documentation.
    - For uniformity across all KNL configurations, always have a NUMA node
      object even if the host is UMA.
  + Fix the detection of the memory-side cache:

      into /var/run/hwloc/ as root during boot, and load this dumped
      information from the hwloc library at runtime.
    - See "Why do I need hwloc-dump-hwdata for caches on Intel Knights
      Landing Xeon Phi?" in the documentation.
  Thanks to Grzegorz Andrejczuk for the patches and for the help.
* The x86 and linux backends may now be combined for discovering CPUs

  See "How do I handle ABI breaks and API upgrades ?" in the FAQ.


Version 1.10.0
--------------
* API
  + Add hwloc_topology_export_synthetic() to export a topology to a
    synthetic string without using lstopo. See the Synthetic topologies
    section in the documentation.
  + Add hwloc_topology_set/get_userdata() to let the application save
    a private pointer in the topology whenever it needs a way to find
    its own object corresponding to a topology.
  + Add hwloc_get_numanode_obj_by_os_index() and document that this function
    as well as hwloc_get_pu_obj_by_os_index() are good at converting
    nodesets and cpusets into objects.
  + hwloc_distrib() does not ignore any objects anymore when there are
    too many of them. They get merged with others instead.
    Thanks to Tim Creech for reporting the issue.
* Tools
  + hwloc-bind --get <command-line> now executes the command after displaying
    the binding instead of ignoring the command entirely.
    Thanks to John Donners for the suggestion.
  + Clarify that memory sizes shown in lstopo are local by default
    unless specified (total memory added in the root object).
* Synthetic topologies
  + Synthetic topology descriptions may now specify attributes such as
    memory sizes and OS indexes. See the Synthetic topologies section
    in the documentation.
  + lstopo now exports in this fully-detailed format by default.
    The new option --export-synthetic-flags may be used to revert
    back the old format.
* Documentation
  + Add the doc/examples/ subdirectory with several real-life examples,
    including the already existing hwloc-hello.C for basics.
    Thanks to Rob Aulwes for the suggestion.
  + Improve the documentation of CPU and memory binding in the API.
  + Add a FAQ entry about operating system errors, especially on AMD
    platforms with buggy cache information.
  + Add a FAQ entry about loading many topologies in a single program.
* Misc
  + Work around buggy Linux kernels reporting 2 sockets instead
    1 socket with 2 NUMA nodes for each Xeon E5 v3 (Haswell) processor.
  + pciutils/libpci support is now removed since libpciaccess works
    well and there's also a Linux-specific PCI backend. For the record,
    pciutils was GPL and therefore disabled by default since v1.6.2.
  + Add --disable-cpuid configure flag to work around buggy processor
    simulators reporting invalid CPUID information.
    Thanks for Andrew Friedley for reporting the issue.
  + Fix a racy use of libltdl when manipulating multiple topologies in
    different threads.
    Thanks to Andra Hugo for reporting the issue and testing patches.
  + Fix some build failures in private/misc.h.
    Thanks to Pavan Balaji and Ralph Castain for the reports.
  + Fix failures to detect X11/Xutil.h on some Solaris platforms.
    Thanks to Siegmar Gross for reporting the failure.
  + The plugin ABI has changed, this release will not load plugins
    built against previous hwloc releases.


Version 1.9.1
-------------
* Fix a crash when the PCI locality is invalid. Attach to the root object
  instead. Thanks to Nicolas Denoyelle for reporting the issue.
* Fix -f in lstopo manpage. Thanks to Jirka Hladky for reporting the issue.
* Fix hwloc_obj_type_sscanf() and others when strncasecmp() is not properly
  available. Thanks to Nick Papior Andersen for reporting the problem.
* Mark Linux file descriptors as close-on-exec to avoid leaks on exec.
* Fix some minor memory leaks.


Version 1.9.0
-------------
* API
  + Add hwloc_obj_type_sscanf() to extend hwloc_obj_type_of_string() with
    type-specific attributes such as Cache/Group depth and Cache type.
    hwloc_obj_type_of_string() is moved to hwloc/deprecated.h.
  + Add hwloc_linux_get_tid_last_cpu_location() for retrieving the
    last CPU where a Linux thread given by TID ran.
  + Add hwloc_distrib() to extend the old hwloc_distribute[v]() functions.
    hwloc_distribute[v]() is moved to hwloc/deprecated.h.
  + Don't mix total and local memory when displaying verbose object attributes
    with hwloc_obj_attr_snprintf() or in lstopo.
* Backends
  + Add CPUVendor, CPUModelNumber and CPUFamilyNumber info attributes for
    x86, ia64 and Xeon Phi sockets on Linux, to extend the x86-specific
    support added in v1.8.1. Requested by Ralph Castain.
  + Add many CPU- and Platform-related info attributes on ARM and POWER
    platforms, in the Machine and Socket objects.
  + Add CUDA info attributes describing the number of multiprocessors and
    cores and the size of the global, shared and L2 cache memories in CUDA
    OS devices.
  + Add OpenCL info attributes describing the number of compute units and
    the global memory size in OpenCL OS devices.
  + The synthetic backend now accepts extended types such as L2Cache, L1i or
    Group3. lstopo also exports synthetic strings using these extended types.
* Tools
  + lstopo
    - Do not overwrite output files by default anymore.
      Pass -f or --force to enforce it.
    - Display OpenCL, CUDA and Xeon Phi numbers of cores and memory sizes
      in the graphical output.
    - Fix export to stdout when specifying a Cairo-based output type
      with --of.
  + hwloc-ps
    - Add -e or --get-last-cpu-location to report where processes/threads
      run instead of where they are bound.
    - Report locations as likely-more-useful objects such as Cores or Sockets
      instead of Caches when possible.
  + hwloc-bind
    - Fix failure on Windows when not using --pid.
    - Add -e as a synonym to --get-last-cpu-location.
  + hwloc-distrib
    - Add --reverse to distribute using last objects first and singlify
      into last bits first. Thanks to Jirka Hladky for the suggestion.
  + hwloc-info
    - Report unified caches when looking for data or instruction cache
      ancestor objects.
* Misc
  + Add experimental Visual Studio support under contrib/windows.
    Thanks to Eloi Gaudry for his help and for providing the first draft.
  + Fix some overzealous assertions and warnings about the ordering of
    objects on a level with respect to cpusets. The ordering is only
    guaranteed for complete cpusets (based on the first bit in sets).
  + Fix some memory leaks when importing xml diffs and when exporting a
    "too complex" entry.


Version 1.8.1
-------------
* Fix the cpuid code on Windows 64bits so that the x86 backend gets
  enabled as expected and can populate CPU information.
  Thanks to Robin Scher for reporting the problem.
* Add CPUVendor/CPUModelNumber/CPUFamilyNumber attributes when running
  on x86 architecture. Thanks to Ralph Castain for the suggestion.
* Work around buggy BIOS reporting duplicate NUMA nodes on Linux.
  Thanks to Jeff Becker for reporting the problem and testing the patch.
* Add a name to the lstopo graphical window. Thanks to Michael Prokop
  for reporting the issue.


Version 1.8.0
-------------
* New components
  + Add the "linuxpci" component that always works on Linux even when
    libpciaccess and libpci aren't available (and even with a modified
    file-system root). By default the old "pci" component runs first
    because "linuxpci" lacks device names (obj->name is always NULL).
* API
  + Add the topology difference API in hwloc/diff.h for manipulating
    many similar topologies.
  + Add hwloc_topology_dup() for duplicating an entire topology.
  + hwloc.h and hwloc/helper.h have been reorganized to clarify the
    documentation sections. The actual inline code has moved out of hwloc.h
    into the new hwloc/inlines.h.
  + Deprecated functions are now in hwloc/deprecated.h, and not in the
    official documentation anymore.
* Tools
  + Add hwloc-diff and hwloc-patch tools together with the new diff API.
  + Add hwloc-compress-dir to (de)compress an entire directory of XML files
    using hwloc-diff and hwloc-patch.
  + Object colors in the graphical output of lstopo may be changed by adding
    a "lstopoStyle" info attribute. See CUSTOM COLORS in the lstopo(1) manpage
    for details. Thanks to Jirka Hladky for discussing the idea.
  + hwloc-gather-topology may now gather I/O-related files on Linux when
    --io is given. Only the linuxpci component supports discovering I/O
    objects from these extended tarballs.
  + hwloc-annotate now supports --ri to remove/replace info attributes with
    a given name.
  + hwloc-info supports "root" and "all" special locations for dumping
    information about the root object.
  + lstopo now supports --append-legend to append custom lines of text
    to the legend in the graphical output. Thanks to Jirka Hladky for
    discussing the idea.
  + hwloc-calc and friends have a more robust parsing of locations given
    on the command-line and they report useful error messages about it.
  + Add --whole-system to hwloc-bind, hwloc-calc, hwloc-distances and
    hwloc-distrib, and add --restrict to hwloc-bind for uniformity among
    tools.
* Misc
  + Calling hwloc_topology_load() or hwloc_topology_set_*() on an already
    loaded topology now returns an error (deprecated since release 1.6.1).
  + Fix the initialisation of cpusets and nodesets in Group objects added
    when inserting PCI hostbridges.
  + Never merge Group objects that were added explicitly by the user with
    hwloc_custom_insert_group_object_by_parent().
  + Add a sanity check during dynamic plugin loading to prevent some
    crashes when hwloc is dynamically loaded by another plugin mechanisms.
  + Add --with-hwloc-plugins-path to specify the install/load directories
    of plugins.
  + Add the MICSerialNumber info attribute to the root object when running
    hwloc inside a Xeon Phi to match the same attribute in the MIC OS device
    when running in the host.


Version 1.7.2
-------------
* Do not create invalid block OS devices on very old Linux kernel such
  as RHEL4 2.6.9.
* Fix PCI subvendor/device IDs.
* Fix the management of Misc objects inserted by parent.
  Thanks to Jirka Hladky for reporting the problem.
* Add a Port<n>State into attribute to OpenFabrics OS devices.
* Add a MICSerialNumber info attribute to Xeon PHI/MIC OS devices.
* Improve verbose error messages when failing to load from XML.


Version 1.7.1
-------------
* Fix a failed assertion in the distance grouping code when loading a XML
  file that already contains some groups.
  Thanks to Laercio Lima Pilla for reporting the problem.
* Remove unexpected Group objects when loading XML topologies with I/O
  objects and NUMA distances.
  Thanks to Elena Elkina for reporting the problem and testing patches.
* Fix PCI link speed discovery when using libpciaccess.
* Fix invalid libpciaccess virtual function device/vendor IDs when using
  SR-IOV PCI devices on Linux.
* Fix GL component build with old NVCtrl releases.
  Thanks to Jirka Hladky for reporting the problem.
* Fix embedding breakage caused by libltdl.
  Thanks to Pavan Balaji for reporting the problem.
* Always use the system-wide libltdl instead of shipping one inside hwloc.
* Document issues when enabling plugins while embedding hwloc in another
  project, in the documentation section Embedding hwloc in Other Software.
* Add a FAQ entry "How to get useful topology information on NetBSD?"
  in the documentation.
* Somes fixes in the renaming code for embedding.
* Miscellaneous minor build fixes.


Version 1.7.0
-------------
* New operating system backends
  + Add BlueGene/Q compute node kernel (CNK) support. See the FAQ in the
    documentation for details. Thanks to Jeff Hammond, Christopher Samuel
    and Erik Schnetter for their help.
  + Add NetBSD support, thanks to Aleksej Saushev.
* New I/O device discovery
  + Add co-processor OS devices such as "mic0" for Intel Xeon Phi (MIC)
    on Linux. Thanks to Jerome Vienne for helping.
  + Add co-processor OS devices such as "cuda0" for NVIDIA CUDA-capable GPUs.
  + Add co-processor OS devices such as "opencl0d0" for OpenCL GPU devices
    on the AMD OpenCL implementation.
  + Add GPU OS devices such as ":0.0" for NVIDIA X11 displays.
  + Add GPU OS devices such as "nvml0" for NVIDIA GPUs.
    Thanks to Marwan Abdellah and Stefan Eilemann for helping.
  These new OS devices have some string info attributes such as CoProcType,
  GPUModel, etc. to better identify them.
  See the I/O Devices and Attributes documentation sections for details.
* New components
  + Add the "opencl", "cuda", "nvml" and "gl" components for I/O device
    discovery.
  + "nvml" also improves the discovery of NVIDIA GPU PCIe link speed.
  All of these new components may be built as plugins. They may also be
  disabled entirely by passing --disable-opencl/cuda/nvml/gl to configure.
  See the I/O Devices, Components and Plugins, and FAQ documentation
  sections for details.
* API
  + Add hwloc_topology_get_flags().
  + Add hwloc/plugins.h for building external plugins.
    See the Adding new discovery components and plugins section.
* Interoperability
  + Add hwloc/opencl.h, hwloc/nvml.h, hwloc/gl.h and hwloc/intel-mic.h
    to retrieve the locality of OS devices that correspond to AMD OpenCL
    GPU devices or indexes, to NVML devices or indexes, to NVIDIA X11
    displays, or to Intel Xeon Phi (MIC) device indexes.
  + Add new helpers in hwloc/cuda.h and hwloc/cudart.h to convert
    between CUDA devices or indexes and hwloc OS devices.
  + Add hwloc_ibv_get_device_osdev() and clarify the requirements
    of the OpenFabrics Verbs helpers in hwloc/openfabrics-verbs.h.
* Tools
  + hwloc-info is not only a synonym of lstopo -s anymore, it also
    dumps information about objects given on the command-line.
* Documentation
  + Add a section "Existing components and plugins".
  + Add a list of common OS devices in section "Software devices".
  + Add a new FAQ entry "Why is lstopo slow?" about lstopo slowness
    issues because of GPUs.
  + Clarify the documentation of inline helpers in hwloc/myriexpress.h
    and hwloc/openfabrics-verbs.h.
* Misc
  + Improve cache detection on AIX.
  + The HWLOC_COMPONENTS variable now excludes the components whose
    names are prefixed with '-'.
  + lstopo --ignore PU now works when displaying the topology in
    graphical and textual mode (not when exporting to XML).
  + Make sure I/O options always appear in lstopo usage, not only when
    using pciutils/libpci.
  + Remove some unneeded Linux specific includes from some interoperability
    headers.
  + Fix some inconsistencies in hwloc-distrib and hwloc-assembler-remote
    manpages. Thanks to Guy Streeter for the report.
  + Fix a memory leak on AIX when getting memory binding.
  + Fix many small memory leaks on Linux.
  + The `libpci' component is now called `pci' but the old name is still
    accepted in the HWLOC_COMPONENTS variable for backward compatibility.


Version 1.6.2
-------------
* Use libpciaccess instead of pciutils/libpci by default for I/O discovery.
  pciutils/libpci is only used if --enable-libpci is given to configure
  because its GPL license may taint hwloc. See the Installation section
  in the documentation for details.
* Fix get_cpubind on Solaris when bound to a single PU with
  processor_bind(). Thanks to Eugene Loh for reporting the problem
  and providing a patch.


Version 1.6.1
-------------
* Fix some crash or buggy detection in the x86 backend when Linux
  cgroups/cpusets restrict the available CPUs.
* Fix the pkg-config output with --libs --static.
  Thanks to Erik Schnetter for reporting one of the problems.
* Fix the output of hwloc-calc -H --hierarchical when using logical
  indexes in the output.
* Calling hwloc_topology_load() multiple times on the same topology
  is officially deprecated. hwloc will warn in such cases.
* Add some documentation about existing plugins/components, package
  dependencies, and I/O devices specification on the command-line.


Version 1.6.0
-------------
* Major changes
  + Reorganize the backend infrastructure to support dynamic selection
    of components and dynamic loading of plugins. For details, see the
    new documentation section Components and plugins.
    - The HWLOC_COMPONENTS variable lets one replace the default discovery
      components.
    - Dynamic loading of plugins may be enabled with --enable-plugins
      (except on AIX and Windows). It will build libxml2 and libpci
      support as separated modules. This helps reducing the dependencies
      of the core hwloc library when distributed as a binary package.
* Backends
  + Add CPUModel detection on Darwin and x86/FreeBSD.
    Thanks to Robin Scher for providing ways to implement this.
  + The x86 backend now adds CPUModel info attributes to socket objects
    created by other backends that do not natively support this attribute.
  + Fix detection on FreeBSD in case of cpuset restriction. Thanks to
    Sebastian Kuzminsky for reporting the problem.
* XML
  + Add hwloc_topology_set_userdata_import/export_callback(),
    hwloc_export_obj_userdata() and _userdata_base64() to let
    applications specify how to save/restore the custom data they placed
    in the userdata private pointer field of hwloc objects.
* Tools
  + Add hwloc-annotate program to add string info attributes to XML
    topologies.
  + Add --pid-cmd to hwloc-ps to append the output of a command to each
    PID line. May be used for showing Open MPI process ranks, see the
    hwloc-ps(1) manpage for details.
  + hwloc-bind now exits with an error if binding fails; the executable
    is not launched unless binding suceeeded or --force was given.
  + Add --quiet to hwloc-calc and hwloc-bind to hide non-fatal error
    messages.
  + Fix command-line pid support in windows tools.
  + All programs accept --verbose as a synonym to -v.
* Misc
  + Fix some DIR descriptor leaks on Linux.
  + Fix I/O device lists when some were filtered out after a XML import.
  + Fix the removal of I/O objects when importing a I/O-enabled XML topology
    without any I/O topology flag.
  + When merging objects with HWLOC_IGNORE_TYPE_KEEP_STRUCTURE or
    lstopo --merge, compare object types before deciding which one of two
    identical object to remove (e.g. keep sockets in favor of caches).
  + Add some GUID- and LID-related info attributes to OpenFabrics
    OS devices.
  + Only add CPUType socket attributes on Solaris/Sparc. Other cases
    don't report reliable information (Solaris/x86), and a replacement
    is available as the Architecture string info in the Machine object.
  + Add missing Backend string info on Solaris in most cases.
  + Document object attributes and string infos in a new Attributes
    section in the documentation.
  + Add a section about Synthetic topologies in the documentation.


Version 1.5.2 (some of these changes are in 1.6.2 but not in 1.6)
-------------
* Use libpciaccess instead of pciutils/libpci by default for I/O discovery.
  pciutils/libpci is only used if --enable-libpci is given to configure
  because its GPL license may taint hwloc. See the Installation section
  in the documentation for details.
* Fix get_cpubind on Solaris when bound to a single PU with
  processor_bind(). Thanks to Eugene Loh for reporting the problem
  and providing a patch.
* Fix some DIR descriptor leaks on Linux.
* Fix I/O device lists when some were filtered out after a XML import.
* Add missing Backend string info on Solaris in most cases.
* Fix the removal of I/O objects when importing a I/O-enabled XML topology
  without any I/O topology flag.
* Fix the output of hwloc-calc -H --hierarchical when using logical
  indexes in the output.
* Fix the pkg-config output with --libs --static.
  Thanks to Erik Schnetter for reporting one of the problems.


Version 1.5.1
-------------
* Fix block OS device detection on Linux kernel 3.3 and later.
  Thanks to Guy Streeter for reporting the problem and testing the fix.
* Fix the cpuid code in the x86 backend (for FreeBSD). Thanks to
  Sebastian Kuzminsky for reporting problems and testing patches.
* Fix 64bit detection on FreeBSD.
* Fix some corner cases in the management of the thissystem flag with
  respect to topology flags and environment variables.
* Fix some corner cases in command-line parsing checks in hwloc-distrib
  and hwloc-distances.
* Make sure we do not miss some block OS devices on old Linux kernels
  when a single PCI device has multiple IDE hosts/devices behind it.
* Do not disable I/O devices or instruction caches in hwloc-assembler output.


Version 1.5.0
-------------
* Backends
  + Do not limit the number of processors to 1024 on Solaris anymore.
  + Gather total machine memory on FreeBSD. Thanks to Cyril Roelandt.
  + XML topology files do not depend on the locale anymore. Float numbers
    such as NUMA distances or PCI link speeds now always use a dot as a
    decimal separator.
  + Add instruction caches detection on Linux, AIX, Windows and Darwin.
  + Add get_last_cpu_location() support for the current thread on AIX.
  + Support binding on AIX when threads or processes were bound with
    bindprocessor(). Thanks to Hendryk Bockelmann for reporting the issue
    and testing patches, and to Farid Parpia for explaining the binding
    interfaces.
  + Improve AMD topology detection in the x86 backend (for FreeBSD) using
    the topoext feature.
* API
  + Increase HWLOC_API_VERSION to 0x00010500 so that API changes may be
    detected at build-time.
  + Add a cache type attribute describind Data, Instruction and Unified
    caches. Caches with different types but same depth (for instance L1d
    and L1i) are placed on different levels.
  + Add hwloc_get_cache_type_depth() to retrieve the hwloc level depth of
    of the given cache depth and type, for instance L1i or L2.
    It helps  disambiguating the case where hwloc_get_type_depth() returns
    HWLOC_TYPE_DEPTH_MULTIPLE.
  + Instruction caches are ignored unless HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_ICACHES is
    passed to hwloc_topology_set_flags() before load.
  + Add hwloc_ibv_get_device_osdev_by_name() OpenFabrics helper in
    openfabrics-verbs.h to find the hwloc OS device object corresponding to
    an OpenFabrics device.
* Tools
  + Add lstopo-no-graphics, a lstopo built without graphical support to
    avoid dependencies on external libraries such as Cairo and X11. When
    supported, graphical outputs are only available in the original lstopo
    program.
    - Packagers splitting lstopo and lstopo-no-graphics into different
      packages are advised to use the alternatives system so that lstopo
      points to the best available binary.
  + Instruction caches are enabled in lstopo by default. Use --no-icaches
    to disable them.
  + Add -t/--threads to show threads in hwloc-ps.
* Removal of obsolete components
  + Remove the old cpuset interface (hwloc/cpuset.h) which is deprecated and
    superseded by the bitmap API (hwloc/bitmap.h) since v1.1.
    hwloc_cpuset and nodeset types are still defined, but all hwloc_cpuset_*
    compatibility wrappers are now gone.
  + Remove Linux libnuma conversion helpers for the deprecated and
    broken nodemask_t interface.
  + Remove support for "Proc" type name, it was superseded by "PU" in v1.0.
  + Remove hwloc-mask symlinks, it was replaced by hwloc-calc in v1.0.
* Misc
  + Fix PCIe 3.0 link speed computation.
  + Non-printable characters are dropped from strings during XML export.
  + Fix importing of escaped characters with the minimalistic XML backend.
  + Assert hwloc_is_thissystem() in several I/O related helpers.
  + Fix some memory leaks in the x86 backend for FreeBSD.
  + Minor fixes to ease native builds on Windows.
  + Limit the number of retries when operating on all threads within a
    process on Linux if the list of threads is heavily getting modified.


Version 1.4.3
-------------
* This release is only meant to fix the pciutils license issue when upgrading
  to hwloc v1.5 or later is not possible. It contains several other minor
  fixes but ignores many of them that are only in v1.5 or later.
* Use libpciaccess instead of pciutils/libpci by default for I/O discovery.
  pciutils/libpci is only used if --enable-libpci is given to configure
  because its GPL license may taint hwloc. See the Installation section
  in the documentation for details.
* Fix PCIe 3.0 link speed computation.
* Fix importing of escaped characters with the minimalistic XML backend.
* Fix a memory leak in the x86 backend.


Version 1.4.2
-------------

  built-in. Thanks to Igor Galić for reporting the problem.
* Fix support for more than 32 processors on Windows. Thanks to Hartmut
  Kaiser for reporting the problem.
* Fix process-wide binding and cpulocation routines on Linux when some
  threads disappear in the meantime. Thanks to Vlad Roubtsov for reporting
  the issue.
* Make installed scripts executable. Thanks to Jirka Hladky for reporting
  the problem.
* Fix libtool revision management when building for Windows. This fix was
  also released as hwloc v1.4.1.1 Windows builds. Thanks to Hartmut Kaiser
  for reporting the problem.
* Fix the __hwloc_inline keyword in public headers when compiling with a
  C++ compiler.
* Add Port info attribute to network OS devices inside OpenFabrics PCI
  devices so as to identify which interface corresponds to which port.
* Document requirements for interoperability helpers: I/O devices discovery
  is required for some of them; the topology must match the current host
  for most of them.


Version 1.4.1 (contains all 1.3.2 changes)
-------------
* Fix hwloc_alloc_membind, thanks Karl Napf for reporting the issue.
* Fix memory leaks in some get_membind() functions.

  in case of out-of-order NUMA node ids.
* Fix some overzealous assertions in the distance grouping code.
* Workaround BIOS reporting empty I/O locality in CUDA and OpenFabrics
  helpers on Linux. Thanks to Albert Solernou for reporting the problem.

    of an object within a subtree of the topology.
  + Add more NVIDIA CUDA helpers in cuda.h and cudart.h to find hwloc objects
    corresponding to CUDA devices.
* Discovery improvements
  + Add a group object above partial distance matrices to make sure
    the matrices are available in the final topology, except when this
    new object would contradict the existing hierarchy.
  + Grouping by distances now also works when loading from XML.
  + Fix some corner cases in object insertion, for instance when dealing
    with NUMA nodes without any CPU.
* Backends
  + Implement hwloc_get_area_membind() on Linux.
  + Honor I/O topology flags when importing from XML.
  + Further improve XML-related error checking and reporting.

* Use libpciaccess instead of pciutils/libpci by default for I/O discovery.
  pciutils/libpci is only used if --enable-libpci is given to configure
  because its GPL license may taint hwloc. See the Installation section
  in the documentation for details.

Version 1.1.0
-------------

* API
  + Increase HWLOC_API_VERSION to 0x00010100 so that API changes may be
    detected at build-time.
  + Add a memory binding interface.
  + The cpuset API (hwloc/cpuset.h) is now deprecated. It is replaced by
    the bitmap API (hwloc/bitmap.h) which offers the same features with more
    generic names since it applies to CPU sets, node sets and more.
    Backward compatibility with the cpuset API and ABI is still provided but
    it will be removed in a future release.
    Old types (hwloc_cpuset_t, ...) are still available as a way to clarify
    what kind of hwloc_bitmap_t each API function manipulates.
    Upgrading to the new API only requires to replace hwloc_cpuset_ function
    calls with the corresponding hwloc_bitmap_ calls, with the following
    renaming exceptions:
    - hwloc_cpuset_cpu -> hwloc_bitmap_only
    - hwloc_cpuset_all_but_cpu -> hwloc_bitmap_allbut
    - hwloc_cpuset_from_string -> hwloc_bitmap_sscanf
  + Add an `infos' array in each object to store couples of info names and
    values. It enables generic storage of things like the old dmi board infos
    that were previously stored in machine specific attributes.
  + Add linesize cache attribute.
* Features
  + Bitmaps (and thus CPU sets and node sets) are dynamically (re-)allocated,
    the maximal number of CPUs (HWLOC_NBMAXCPUS) has been removed.
  + Improve the distance-based grouping code to better support irregular
    distance matrices.
  + Add support for device-tree to get cache information (useful on Power
    architectures).
* Helpers
  + Add NVIDIA CUDA helpers in cuda.h and cudart.h to ease interoperability
    with CUDA Runtime and Driver APIs.
  + Add Myrinet Express helper in myriexpress.h to ease interoperability.
* Tools
  + lstopo now displays physical/OS indexes by default in graphical mode
    (use -l to switch back to logical indexes). The textual output still uses
    logical by default (use -p to switch to physical indexes).
  + lstopo prefixes logical indexes with `L#' and physical indexes with `P#'.
    Physical indexes are also printed as `P#N' instead of `phys=N' within
    object attributes (in parentheses).
  + Add a legend at the bottom of the lstopo graphical output, use --no-legend
    to remove it.
  + Add hwloc-ps to list process' bindings.
  + Add --membind and --mempolicy options to hwloc-bind.
  + Improve tools command-line options by adding a generic --input option
    (and more) which replaces the old --xml, --synthetic and --fsys-root.
  + Cleanup lstopo output configuration by adding --output-format.
  + Add --intersect in hwloc-calc, and replace --objects with --largest.
  + Add the ability to work on standard input in hwloc-calc.
  + Add --from, --to and --at in hwloc-distrib.
  + Add taskset-specific functions and command-line tools options to
    manipulate CPU set strings in the format of the taskset program.
  + Install hwloc-gather-topology.sh on Linux.
