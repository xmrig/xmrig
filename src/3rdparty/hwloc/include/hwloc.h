 *
 * FAIR WARNING: Do NOT expect to be able to figure out all the
 * subtleties of hwloc by simply reading function prototypes and
 * constant descrptions here in this file.
 *
 * Hwloc has wonderful documentation in both PDF and HTML formats for
 * your reading pleasure.  The formal documentation explains a LOT of
 * hwloc-specific concepts, provides definitions, and discusses the
 * "big picture" for many of the things that you'll find here in this
 * header file.
 *
 * The PDF/HTML documentation was generated via Doxygen; much of what
 * you'll see in there is also here in this file.  BUT THERE IS A LOT
 * THAT IS IN THE PDF/HTML THAT IS ***NOT*** IN hwloc.h!
 *
 * There are entire paragraph-length descriptions, discussions, and
 * pretty pictures to explain subtle corner cases, provide concrete
 * examples, etc.
 *
 * Please, go read the documentation.  :-)
 *
 * Moreover there are several examples of hwloc use under doc/examples
 * in the source tree.

 *
 * Hwloc uses bitmaps to represent two distinct kinds of object sets:
 * CPU sets (::hwloc_cpuset_t) and NUMA node sets (::hwloc_nodeset_t).
 * These types are both typedefs to a common back end type
 * (::hwloc_bitmap_t), and therefore all the hwloc bitmap functions
 * are applicable to both ::hwloc_cpuset_t and ::hwloc_nodeset_t (see
 * \ref hwlocality_bitmap).
 *
 * The rationale for having two different types is that even though
 * the actions one wants to perform on these types are the same (e.g.,
 * enable and disable individual items in the set/mask), they're used
 * in very different contexts: one for specifying which processors to
 * use and one for specifying which NUMA nodes to use.  Hence, the
 * name difference is really just to reflect the intent of where the
 * type is used.

 * is free to run the task on one of these PU, then migrate it to another PU, etc.
 * It is often useful to call hwloc_bitmap_singlify() on the target CPU set before
 * passing it to the binding function to avoid these expensive migrations.
 * See the documentation of hwloc_bitmap_singlify() for details.
 *
 * Some operating systems do not provide all hwloc-supported

 *
 * When the requested binding operation is not available and the

 * \p errno is set to \c ENOSYS when it is not possible to bind the requested kind of object
 * processes/threads. errno is set to \c EXDEV when the requested cpuset
 * can not be enforced (e.g. some systems only allow one CPU, and some
 * other systems only allow one NUMA node).
 *
 * If ::HWLOC_CPUBIND_STRICT was not passed, the function may fail as well,
 * or the operating system may use a slightly different operation
 * (with side-effects, smaller binding set, etc.)
 * when the requested operation is not exactly supported.
 *
 * The most portable version that should be preferred over the others,
 * whenever possible, is the following one which just binds the current program,
 * assuming it is single-threaded:
 *
 * \code
 * hwloc_set_cpubind(topology, set, 0),

 *
 * \sa Some example codes are available under doc/examples/ in the source tree.

 * - implicit memory binding through binding policy: hwloc_set_membind() and

 *   applied to the subsequent calls to malloc() and friends.
 * - migration of existing memory ranges, thanks to hwloc_set_area_membind()
 *   and friends, which move already-allocated data.
 *
 * Not all operating systems support all three ways.

 * When the requested binding operation is not available and the

 * (e.g., some systems only allow binding memory on a per-thread
 * basis, whereas other systems only allow binding memory for all

 *
 * The most portable form that should be preferred over the others

 * To do so, hwloc will possibly have to change the current memory
 * binding policy in order to actually get the memory bound, if the OS

 *
 * The caller should first allocate a new Group object with hwloc_topology_alloc_group_object().
 * Then it must setup at least one of its CPU or node sets to specify
 * the final location of the Group in the topology.
 * Then the object can be passed to this function for actual insertion in the topology.
 *
 * The main use case for this function is to group a subset of
 * siblings among the list of children below a single parent.
 * For instance, if grouping 4 cores out of a 8-core socket,
 * the logical list of cores will be reordered so that the 4 grouped
 * ones are consecutive.
 * Then, if needed, a new depth is added between the parent and those
 * children, and the Group is inserted there.
 * At the end, the 4 grouped cores are now children of the Group,
 * which replaces them as a child of the original parent.
 *
 * In practice, the grouped objects are specified through cpusets
 * and/or nodesets, for instance using hwloc_obj_add_other_obj_sets()
 * iteratively.
 * Hence it is possible to group objects that are not children of the
 * same parent, for instance some PUs below the 4 cores in example above.
 * However this general case may fail if the expected Group conflicts
 * with the existing hierarchy.
 * For instance if each core has two PUs, it is not possible to insert
 * a Group containing a single PU of each core.
 *
 * To specify the objects to group, either the cpuset or nodeset field
 * (or both, if compatible) must be set to a non-empty bitmap.
 * The complete_cpuset or complete_nodeset may be set instead if
 * inserting with respect to the complete topology
 * (including disallowed, offline or unknown objects).
 * These sets cannot be larger than the current topology, or they would get
 * restricted silently.
 * The core will setup the other sets after actual insertion.
 *
 * The \p subtype object attribute may be defined with hwloc_obj_set_subtype()
 * to display something else than "Group" as the type name for this object in lstopo.
 * Custom name-value info pairs may be added with hwloc_obj_add_info() after
 * insertion.
 *
 * The group \p dont_merge attribute may be set to \c 1 to prevent
 * the hwloc core from ever merging this object with another
 * hierarchically-identical object.
 * This is useful when the Group itself describes an important feature
 * that cannot be exposed anywhere else in the hierarchy.
 *
 * The group \p kind attribute may be set to a high value such
 * as \c 0xffffffff to tell hwloc that this new Group should always
 * be discarded in favor of any existing Group with the same locality.
 *
 * \note Inserting a group adds some locality information to the topology,
 * hence the existing objects may get reordered (including PUs and NUMA nodes),
 * and their logical indexes may change.
 *
 * \note If the insertion fails, the input group object is freed.
 *
 * \note If the group object should be discarded instead of inserted,
 * it may be passed to hwloc_topology_free_group_object() instead.
 *
 * \note \p topology must be the same as the one previously passed
 * to hwloc_topology_alloc_group_object().
 *
 * \return The inserted object if it was properly inserted.
