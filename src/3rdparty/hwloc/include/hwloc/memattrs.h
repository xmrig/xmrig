/** \defgroup hwlocality_memattrs Comparing memory node attributes for finding where to allocate on
 *
 * Platforms with heterogeneous memory require ways to decide whether
 * a buffer should be allocated on "fast" memory (such as HBM),
 * "normal" memory (DDR) or even "slow" but large-capacity memory
 * (non-volatile memory).
 * These memory nodes are called "Targets" while the CPU accessing them
 * is called the "Initiator". Access performance depends on their
 * locality (NUMA platforms) as well as the intrinsic performance
 * of the targets (heterogeneous platforms).
 *
 * The following attributes describe the performance of memory accesses
 * from an Initiator to a memory Target, for instance their latency
 * or bandwidth.
 * Initiators performing these memory accesses are usually some PUs or Cores
 * (described as a CPU set).
 * Hence a Core may choose where to allocate a memory buffer by comparing
 * the attributes of different target memory nodes nearby.
 *
 * There are also some attributes that are system-wide.
 * Their value does not depend on a specific initiator performing
 * an access.
 * The memory node Capacity is an example of such attribute without
 * initiator.
 *
 * One way to use this API is to start with a cpuset describing the Cores where
 * a program is bound. The best target NUMA node for allocating memory in this
 * program on these Cores may be obtained by passing this cpuset as an initiator
 * to hwloc_memattr_get_best_target() with the relevant memory attribute.
 * For instance, if the code is latency limited, use the Latency attribute.
 *
 * A more flexible approach consists in getting the list of local NUMA nodes
 * by passing this cpuset to hwloc_get_local_numanode_objs().
 * Attribute values for these nodes, if any, may then be obtained with
 * hwloc_memattr_get_value() and manually compared with the desired criteria.
 *
 * Memory attributes are also used internally to build Memory Tiers which provide
 * an easy way to distinguish NUMA nodes of different kinds, as explained
 * in \ref heteromem.
 *
 * \sa An example is available in doc/examples/memory-attributes.c in the source tree.
 *
 * \note The API also supports specific objects as initiator,
 * but it is currently not used internally by hwloc.
 * Users may for instance use it to provide custom performance
 * values for host memory accesses performed by GPUs.
 *
 * \note The interface actually also accepts targets that are not NUMA nodes.
