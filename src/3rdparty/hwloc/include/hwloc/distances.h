/** \brief Matrix of distances between a set of objects.
 *
 * The most common matrix contains latencies between NUMA nodes
 * (as reported in the System Locality Distance Information Table (SLIT)
 * in the ACPI specification), which may or may not be physically accurate.
 * It corresponds to the latency for accessing the memory of one node
 * from a core in another node.
 * The corresponding kind is ::HWLOC_DISTANCES_KIND_MEANS_LATENCY | ::HWLOC_DISTANCES_KIND_FROM_USER.
 * The name of this distances structure is "NUMALatency".
 *
 * The matrix may also contain bandwidths between random sets of objects,
 * possibly provided by the user, as specified in the \p kind attribute.
 * Others common distance structures include and "XGMIBandwidth", "XGMIHops",
 * "XeLinkBandwidth" and "NVLinkBandwidth".
 *
 * Pointers \p objs and \p values should not be replaced, reallocated, freed, etc.
 * However callers are allowed to modify \p kind as well as the contents
 * of \p objs and \p values arrays.
 * For instance, if there is a single NUMA node per Package,
 * hwloc_get_obj_with_same_locality() may be used to convert between them
 * and replace NUMA nodes in the \p objs array with the corresponding Packages.
 * See also hwloc_distances_transform() for applying some transformations
 * to the structure.
